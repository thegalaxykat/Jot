# Jot: A Menubar Scratchpad for MacOS

Jot is a simple menubar scratchpad for MacOS. It's a place to quickly jot down notes and todos that you don't want to keep around forever. It's not a replacement for a full-featured note-taking app, but it's great for quickly jotting down a phone number, idea, or anything in your head you don't want to forget.

Jot only has a single note, forcing you to avoid clutter. This is intentional. It's meant to be a place to quickly jot down a note and then clear it out when you're done. If you want to keep a note around, you can copy it to your clipboard and paste it into a note-taking app.

That being said, Jot will **automatically save your changes** so you don't lose your note if you quit the app or restart your computer.
